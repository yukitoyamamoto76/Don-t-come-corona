Some Variables and Methods are not shown here.
Also, feel free to add your own Custom GUI in place of the virusGUI skin.
The windows are drawn in the Popup() function if you want to edit them.

### I recommend that there only be one VirusGUI script active at a time.

Class VirusGUI -

Variables -
- virus
	Provides easy access to modify PopupWindows in the latest created VirusGUI.
	Access it by using VirusGUI.virus

- virusGUI
	Define your custom gui in the inspector

- popupWindows;
- multiWindows;
	When a PopupWindow or MultiWindow is created, they are added into their respective array
	so they can be accessed later. These can be added in the inspector so they can be shown
	on startup.

- WindowType {Error, Warning}
	This changes how the window buttons will be displayed.

Methods
- RemovePopupsWithFunctionObject(GameObject functionObject)
	This function will search the popupWindows array and will find
	which ones have the specified functionObject as the Game Object
	to send messages to. If the window has the same functionObject,
	the window is deleted.

	To access this, use
	virus.RemovePopupsWithFunctionObject(gameObject)

	and specify the desired Game Object

- MoveRect(Rect rect, Vector2 move)
	Moves "rect" by the amount in "move" then returns a new rect.

- StayOnScreen(Rect rect)
	If the "rect" goes off screen, its position is recalculated to
	put it back on screen then returns the new rect.

- RandomPointOnScreen()
	Returns a random point on the screen
